          <h1>Love and hip hop or country romance?</h1>

          <p>
            What strums your heart strings: country music or hip hop? 
            Can we classify one as superior when it comes to matters of affection? This project
            aims to see if analysis using machine learning algorithms will suggest that one genre
            is more romantic in comparison with the other.
          </p>

          <p> My love of country music is in my blood. My mom's family is from the deep south specifically Mississippi
            and I grew up listening 
            to Hank Williams and Patsy Cline along with another child of the region, Elvis Presley. 
            I've got a bias towards the belief that country music is more romantic than many other 
            styles if
            looking at lyrics alone and argue that as a genre, it is loaded with phrases evoking and
            expressing a longing that does not show up as frequently in pop.    
            So, in the pursuit of figuring out whether this is true or not, I did what any data professional would do 
            and used the "super powers" of data science to see 
            see what might turn up.

        <h2>The approach</h2>
        <p>I retrieved two randomly generated sets of playlists from two categories namely: "country romance" and "hip hop romance"
          using the Spotify API developer tools. This resulted in two lists which housed approximately 800 songs each. 
          I took the song list extracted from Spotify and processed them using the API provided by genius.com
          resulting in the lyric text for the combined 
          total of 1600 tracks. The wording from all of these songs were subsequently normalized and cleaned with the 
          Python programming language and processed using natural language machine learning algorithms. 
          This process of extraction and tranformation provided the basis for evaluating each genre and finding distinct word patterns 
          along with their use frequencies.

        <h2>Love and hip hop</h2>
        <p>
            The detractors referenced above who would argue against me could point to the fact that 
            the word "love"            
            ranks at a higher frequency in hip hop compared to country as is seen in the chart below. 
            Note that it
            comes in at 2nd place in 
            comparison with 4th in country. The counter argument could be that even though 
            this may be true, the word "love" itself appears approximately 2,500 times
            in the random sampling of country lyrics versus 1750 in hip hop.

        <h2>Analysis</h2>

        <p>
          Putting the fundamental flaws of the project aside, namely a relatively small amount of data in 
          combination with the "elephant in the room" which is that language is rich and cannot be fully 
          evaluated by examining words out of context,
          evidence suggests that country is more romantic. For one thing, nouns dominate hip hop while country 
          lyrics contain a more even handed variety of pronouns, adjectives and adverbs. This suggests 
          the possibility of greater language complexity in country music
          which can be a byproduct of expressing emotion. Additionally, phrases suggestive of
          being polite and content
          such as, "god", "mam'" and "home" made the country music list but 
          expletives did not and the reverse is true for hip hop. 
          
        </p>  
        <p>
          The above being said, none of this is conclusive and can be easily counter argued. 
          For example my assumption around the use of the word 'god' is anectdotal and 
          stems from familiarity with 
          the culture. For example, from an unbiased perspective, the frequent reference to a higher power could also suggest 
          religious ferver or could easily come from the saying: "Oh my god".
          Deeper inquiries may produce different conclusions and if I was to stay within the machine learning model 
          for analysis, it           
          would be helpful to get a larger data sample, and next steps could include 
          sentiment analyis, evaluation of common phrases instead of individual words and also the inclusion of song release dates 
          to see if language has changed over time.

            Much like the perks associated with being a restaurant reviewer having 
            access to great food, 
            this analysis required a fair amount of listening to good music and ultimately 
            hip hop kept me tapping my foot while programming.
